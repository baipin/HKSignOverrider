## Introduction
This is the module for Cities: Skylines II to override the vanilla road signs into Hong Kong template.  

## Important: After adding to playset...
**Notes: if you have already subscribed [Hong Kong Signs Pack](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/128035/Windows) mod, no need to do the following steps.**  
If your game is in Chinese edition, the default road names are in Chinese, to ensure the road name plates operate correctly, you need to import Chinese font by yourself. But it is very easy, just do like this:  
* Font "匯文港黑" is recommended, download [here](https://github.com/baipin/HongKongsigns/blob/master/_BaseModule/Resources/fonts/Huiwenganghei.ttf). And copy it to C:\Users\\[Your username]\AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\ModsData\\.Klyte45Mods\WriteEverywhere\fonts (if no fonts folder, please create one by yourself). 
* Enter your savegame.
* Click the Write Everywhere buttom on the left-top (A circled "W").
* Choose "CITY FONTS" tab.
* Click "+".
* Select "Huiwenganghei.ttf"(the file you just download) , click "OK".
* You are done!

## How to use another Chinese font for Road Name Sign?
* Just rename your font .ttf file to "Huiwenganghei.ttf", and operate the same steps as above.
