  <ShortDescription Value="A WriteEverywhere-Module that replaces Vanilla Signs with Hong Kong ones." />
  <LongDescription># The module is under development. But you can subscribe to take an early look.

Development Progress:  
✅Images Preparation  
✅Layouts Preparation  
🔳3D-model Re-development  
🔳Road Name Sign Re-design  

This means that you can subscribe and use safely now, but the 3D model may not quite fit the sign.  

Thanks:
